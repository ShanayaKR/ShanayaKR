- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShanayaKR
- 👀 I’m interested in developing websites and applications, and in making them accessibility compliant to WCAG standards.
- 🌱 I’m currently 15 months into a 2-year Level 4 Software Developer Apprenticeship at Royal Cornwall Hospital NHS Trust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nhsuk-frontend library and nightingale related stuff. I think it's a fantastic idea to capitalise on the well-known NHS branding and see no point in an NHS website being flashy. I look forward to being more familiar with both so that I can contribute to improving the NHS's web presence.
